# 🎡 CSS Ferris Wheel Animation

This project is a simple **Ferris Wheel animation** built using **HTML** and **CSS**.  
The Ferris Wheel rotates continuously while the cabins also rotate and change colors during the animation.  

---

## ✨ Features
- Ferris Wheel rotates infinitely with smooth animation.  
- Six cabins placed symmetrically around the wheel.  
- Cabins rotate counter to the wheel’s movement, mimicking real Ferris Wheel physics.  
- Cabins change colors during the ride (red → yellow → purple → teal).  
- Responsive design (maximum size 500px for both width and height).  
- Background gradient for a nice visual effect.
